# Stytch Management Python Library

The Stytch Management Python library makes it easy to use Stytch's Programmatic Workspace Actions API in Python applications.

This library requires Python 3.8 or later.

## Installation

```bash
pip install stytch-management
```

## Pre-requisites

You need your Stytch Management API credentials from the workspace management section of your
[Stytch Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/settings/management-api).

**Note:** These credentials allow you to perform read and write actions on your workspace,
potentially modifying or deleting important Stytch resources like projects, environments, or secrets.

## Examples

### Create a new API client:

```python
from stytch_management import Client

# Set your Stytch Management API credentials
client = Client(
    workspace_key_id="workspace-test-...",
    workspace_key_secret="secret-test-..."
)
```

### Create a new B2B project:

```python
response = client.projects.create(
    name="My new project",
    vertical="B2B"
)

new_project = response.project
print(f"Created project: {new_project.project_slug}")
```

### Get the live environment in the new project:

```python
response = client.environments.get_all(
    project_slug=new_project.project_slug
)

live_env = next((env for env in response.environments if env.type == "LIVE"), None)
print(f"Live environment: {live_env.environment_slug}")
```

### Alternatively, create a new custom environment:

```python
response = client.environments.create(
    project_slug=new_project.project_slug,
    name="My custom environment",
    type="TEST"
)

custom_env = response.environment
print(f"Created environment: {custom_env.environment_slug}")
```

### Create a new secret in the live environment:

```python
response = client.secrets.create(
    project_slug=new_project.project_slug,
    environment_slug=live_env.environment_slug
)

secret = response.secret
print(f"Created secret: {secret.secret_id}")
```

### Get SDK configuration:

```python
response = client.sdk.get_consumer_config(
    project_slug=new_project.project_slug,
    environment_slug=live_env.environment_slug
)

print("Consumer SDK config:", response.config)
```

## Type Safety

All request and response types are fully typed using Pydantic models. Import them from the models subpackages:

```python
from stytch_management.models import projects, environments, secrets

# Responses are typed
response: projects.CreateResponse = client.projects.create(
    name="My project",
    vertical="B2B"
)
```

## Error Handling

```python
from stytch_management import Client, StytchError, ClientError

client = Client(
    workspace_key_id="workspace-test-...",
    workspace_key_secret="secret-test-..."
)

try:
    client.projects.get(project_slug="invalid-slug")
except StytchError as e:
    print(f"Stytch error: {e.error_type}")
    print(f"Message: {e.error_message}")
    print(f"Request ID: {e.request_id}")
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Client error: {e.message}")
```

## Running Tests

This library includes comprehensive integration tests that verify functionality against the Stytch API. These tests create and clean up disposable projects and resources.

### Prerequisites

To run the tests, you need valid Stytch Management API credentials:

```bash
export STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_ID="your-workspace-key-id"
export STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_SECRET="your-workspace-key-secret"
```

**Important:** Tests will be skipped if these environment variables are not set. The tests create real resources in your workspace but clean them up automatically.

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover test/

# Run a specific test file
python test/test_secrets.py
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes integration tests for:

- **Email Templates** - Create, get, update, delete, and default management
- **Environments** - Environment lifecycle with user locking and IDP configurations
- **Secrets** - Secret creation, retrieval, and deletion
- **Public Tokens** - Public token management
- **JWT Templates** - Session and M2M JWT template configuration
- **Redirect URLs** - URL validation and type management
- **Password Strength Config** - LUDS and ZXCVBN policy configuration
- **Country Code Allowlist** - SMS and WhatsApp country code management

Each test suite:

- ✓ Creates disposable projects/environments
- ✓ Tests all CRUD operations
- ✓ Validates error handling
- ✓ Cleans up all resources automatically
- ✓ Runs independently without side effects

### Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI environments. Set the environment variables in your CI configuration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
env:
  STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_ID }}
  STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_SECRET }}
```
